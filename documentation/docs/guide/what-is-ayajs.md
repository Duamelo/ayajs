## What is aya ?

<p> Aya is a JavaScript library for building any kind of diagrams quickly and in a programmatic way.</p>

## Motivations
<p>
    We were looking for a code base to easily integrate diagrams into existing applications. 
    Existing solutions are either too heavy or difficult to use. So we wrote a low level library, which allows to build more complex applications like DSL, workflow editors, graphs (like petri network), diagrams (like UML's diagrams) and so on.
    The goal here is to provide a minimal and flexible code base allowing any developer to easily find his way around and build whatever he wants from aya.
    <br/>
    It uses svg document under the hood.

    Aya is very simple to understand.
